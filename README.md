# Overview

As a software engineer I am always looking for ways to incat my ideas into code, and learn about new things that I find interesting. I hope to always be learning and growing in my capacity in this field.

For this project I made a web app incorporating functionality I had made from a previous project on cloud databases to be accessible on a website. You can make a user, log in to the site, and then contribute to a running feed of posts that anyone can access. 

I wrote this software to better understand how to use Django and make web apps. I have enjoyed learning different ways to access information from a website and dynamically write information to it.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Web Pages

* Welcome page - Allows access to 'Sign-up' & 'Log-in' pages, also displays unique messages based off of how your sign up or log in attempts went.

* Sign-up & Log-in pages - call database functions to authenticate the user and allow access to the main site

* Town Square page - This page is dynamically created by the posts that are in the database. 

* Make post page - allows user to make a post in the database and then redirect you back to the town square page

# Future Work


* I would like to integrate the rest of the features from my database into the site including deleting users, updating passwords, and deleting posts.
* Working to make my site more visually pleasing by integrating some CSS files into the project.
* learn how to take the project that I have and host it onto a live server so that it could be accessed from anywhere by anyone.
